PIP Project: Real-Time Banking Transaction Monitoring System - Backend


Real-Time Banking Transaction Monitoring
(Using: Pyspark, Python, Kafka, Airflow, SQL)




Overview: The real-time banking transaction monitoring system aims to provide an end-to-end data processing pipeline that ingests streaming banking transaction data, analyzes it in real-time, and detects potential fraudulent activities using PySpark, Apache Kafka, and Apache Airflow. The system will ensure data integrity, perform real-time aggregations, apply fraud detection algorithms, and send alerts to bank staff or customers when suspicious transactions are identified.




Components:




•Data Source:

•Generate or obtain a continuous stream of banking transaction data. For the sake of the project, you can simulate transactions using Python or use historical transaction data from public datasets (ensure the data is anonymized and does not contain sensitive information).

•Apache Kafka:

•Kafka cluster to act as the messaging system between the data source and the data processing stages. Kafka topics will handle the incoming stream of banking transactions.




•Data Ingestion:

•Develop a Python script for data ingestion. Use a Kafka producer to publish transactions to the Kafka topics. Each transaction should include relevant attributes like transaction amount, account numbers, transaction type, timestamp, etc.

•PySpark Data Processing:

•Create a PySpark streaming job to consume data from Kafka topics in real-time.

•Perform real-time aggregations, such as calculating total transaction amounts per account, transaction counts per account, etc.

•Implement fraud detection logic using PySpark. You can use various techniques like anomaly detection, clustering, machine learning models (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM), or rule-based approaches (e.g., suspicious transaction thresholds).




Fraud Detection:

•Implement a fraud detection module that analyzes the aggregated data and identifies potentially fraudulent transactions.

•Use historical data or labeled datasets to train machine learning models for fraud detection. Continuously update the models using concept drift detection algorithms to adapt to changing patterns in fraud.

•Alerting System:

•Integrate the fraud detection module with an alerting system. When a suspicious transaction is detected, the system should send real-time alerts to designated bank staff or customers through appropriate channels (e.g., email, SMS).

•Data Storage:

•Store the processed data and the results of the fraud detection analysis in a suitable database system, such as Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) or Apache Cassandra, for historical analysis and reporting.




•Apache Airflow Workflow:

•Set up an Apache Airflow DAG to manage the entire pipeline.

•Create tasks for data ingestion, PySpark data processing, and fraud detection.

•Implement task dependencies to ensure a smooth workflow.

•Schedule the DAG to run at predefined intervals or use trigger rules to respond to specific events, such as the arrival of new data.
